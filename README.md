# Meaning of Taekgeuk
Taekwondo encompasses a complete martial art system, from most basic elements of fighting skills to philosophical understanding of the relationship between you and your opponent, your body and mind and wining and losing. The origin of Taekgeuk comes from ancient Eastern metaphysics. **Um** the darker element is **passive** and feminine. **Yang** the brighter element is **active** and masculine. If **Um** reprsents the night, **Yang** reprsents the day. **Um** and **Yang** are complimentary **opposites** rather than **absolutes**. Um and Yang are also known as **Yin** and **Yang**. Nothing in the universe is totally **Um** or **Yang** in nature. **Um** cannot exist without **Yang** and vice versa. The state of balance of the two forces constantly changes themselves through expansion and condensation and fluctuates throught life. The process of this transformation further divides **Um** and **Yang** creating **eight** different phenomena called **Palgwae**. 

The symbol of **Um** is a broken bar and the symbol of **Yang** is a solid bar. The two divide into four stages of Um and Yang and further divide into the eight trigrams. The trigrams in clockwise as follows: 

| Trigram name | Meaning |

| Gon | Earth |
